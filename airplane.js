//Byteland Airlines recently extended their aircraft fleet with a new model of a plane. 
//The new acquisition has n1 rows of seats in the business class and n2 rows in the economic class. 
//In the business class each row contains k1 seats, while each row in the economic class has k2 seats.
//Write a program which:
//reads information about available seats in the plane,
//calculates the sum of all seats available in that plane,
//writes the result.
//In the first and only line of the standard input there are four integers n1, k1, n2 and k2 (1 â‰¤ n1, k1, n2, k2 â‰¤ 1 000), separated by single spaces.
